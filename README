Work with Science History Institute on community history of biotech

Flask app connects with Hypothesis service and Hypothesis client.

1. Start Docker containers for Hypothesis service.
  + In `hypothesis/h/`: 
    + `sudo docker-compose up`
2. Start Hypothesis service.
  + In `hypothesis/h/`:
    + `export CLIENT_OAUTH_ID="<client-id>"`
    + `export CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3001/hypothesis`
    + `make dev`
  + Uses ports 5000, 5001?
3. Start Hypothesis client.
  + In `hypothesis/client/`:
    + `export SIDEBAR_APP_URL=http://localhost:5000/app.html`
    + `gulp watch`
  + Uses ports 3000, 3001
4. Start Flask app.
  + In `science_history_institute/flask/`:
    + `honcho start -f Local -e .env`
  + Uses port 5050

On local machine, need to SSH tunnel to ports 5050, 5000, 5001, 3000?, 3001
e.g.: `ssh -NfL 5050:localhost:5050 username@server.etc`

If the team at Hypothesis adds us as an Oauth client, we won't need to run 1-3 anymore.
